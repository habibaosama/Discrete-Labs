Including set implementation and some number theory

Numbertheory:

*sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm

*Trial Division algorithm

*Implement the extended Euclidean algorithm that finds the greatest common divisor d of two 
positive integers a and b. In addition, it outputs Bezout’s coefficients s and t such that 
d = s a + t b

*Implement Chinese remainder theorem that takes as input m1, m2, m3, …., mn that are 
pairwise relatively prime and (a1, a2, …., an) and calculates x such that
x = a1 (mod m1)
x = a2 (mod m2)
…
x= an (mod mn)

*Implement Miller’s test (a probabilistic primality test)
